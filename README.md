# housinghighlights
Proposal: we will be analyzing Colorado housing data and demographic trends from Zillow and the US Department of Agriculture. 
Questions our project seeks to answer:
  1. To start, how have house sales (count) in Colorado changed over time?
  2. What explains this change in housing trends? For example, what have the migration trends in CO been over the last eight years? What counties have been attracting the most people? From which counties are people leaving?
  3. How have house prices changed in the most popular counties in the last eight years? How have house prices changed in the least popular counties?
  4. How many houses were sold in the most popular county? In the least popular county?
