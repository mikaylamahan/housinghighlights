# housinghighlights
Proposal: we will be analyzing Denver housing data from, to start, Zillow and the US Department of Agriculture. 
Questions our project seeks to answer:
  1. The Greater Denver Area has experienced an influx of migration over the last five years. Is there a correlation between population growth and homeownership in Colorado? Are new migrants renters or homeowners?
  2. Which counties/zip codes have experienced the biggest rise in home prices over the last five years?
  3. What's the demographic makeup of homeowners in Colorado? By zipcode/county?
  4. Where are the most affordable neighborhoods in the Greater Denver Area?
