# housinghighlights
Proposal: we will be analyzing Colorado housing data and demographic trends from Zillow and the US Department of Agriculture. 
Questions our project seeks to answer:
  1. To start, how have house sales (count) in Colorado changed over time?
  2. What helps explain this change in housing trends? For example, what have the migration trends in CO been over the last eight years? What counties have been attracting the most people? From which counties are people leaving?
  3. How have house prices changed in the most popular counties in the last eight years? How have house prices changed in the least popular counties?
  4. How many houses were sold in the most popular county? In the least popular county?

  
  These are the jupyter notebooks that matter (the rest are drafts):
  1. Lloriv's jupyter notebook titled "graph.py"--still needs to be added to this repository.
  2. Mikayla's jupter notebook titled "reading_censusdata_updatedwithgraph.ipynb". 
  3. Ariel's jupyter notebooks titled "sales_by_county-checkpoint.ipynb" and "Median_House_Price-checkpoint.ipynb".
 
Conclusions:
  
The data shows that there has been a significant increase in home sales in Colorado over the last 10 years. 
  
A contributing factor in the rise of home sales could be the high amount of migration to Colorado year-over-year over the last 8 years: with an average net migration of 50,000 people per year statewide.
 
In the most popular counties, median houses prices have risen dramatically over the same timeframe. There has also been an increase in house sales. In Denver County, the county with the highest average net migration per year, median house prices have close to doubled in the last 8 years. House sales have largely increased as well. This data would support the relationship of price to supply and demand: with more people moving to these counties there is more demand for housing, causing a rise in house sales and a corresponding bump in the price of housing.

We did not have enough data to measure the trends in median house prices in the least popular counties over time. However, surprisingly, the median home price in 2018 for the least popular county in CO, Eagle County, was higher than the most popular county. House sales in the least popular county also rose like their most popular counterparts. This could be explained by the prime real estate in Eagle County instead of by migration pressures. Eagle County is home to Vail and other scenic, popular mountain towns.
